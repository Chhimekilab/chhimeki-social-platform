# Logout Test Guide - Chhimeki Social Platform

## ✅ **Logout Issue Fixed!**

I've identified and fixed the logout problem. The issue was that the App component was trying to use `logout` but the AuthContext exports `signOut`.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

1. **Updated App Component** - Changed `logout` to `signOut`
2. **Updated Logout Button** - Fixed the onClick handler
3. **Added Debug Logging** - To help track logout process
4. **Verified Mock Service** - Confirmed signOut function works correctly

## 🚀 **How to Test Logout:**

### **1. Current Status**
- You should be logged in as a demo user
- The logout button should now be functional

### **2. Test Logout**
1. **Find the Logout Button** - Look for a logout icon (usually in the header/navigation)
2. **Click the Logout Button** - It should be a button with a logout icon
3. **Check Console** - Open browser dev tools (F12) to see debug messages

### **3. Expected Behavior**
- ✅ Console should show: "🔄 Logout button clicked"
- ✅ Console should show: "🔄 Signing out user..."
- ✅ Console should show: "✅ User signed out successfully"
- ✅ You should be redirected to the login screen
- ✅ User session should be cleared

### **4. If Logout Still Doesn't Work**

#### **Check Browser Console:**
1. Press `F12` to open developer tools
2. Go to the `Console` tab
3. Click the logout button
4. Look for any error messages

#### **Manual Logout (if needed):**
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to `Application` tab (Chrome) or `Storage` tab (Firefox)
3. Find `Local Storage`
4. Delete the `mock_auth_session` entry
5. Refresh the page

#### **Clear All Data:**
1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
4. This will clear all stored data

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions:**

### **Issue: Button not responding**
- **Solution**: Check if there are JavaScript errors in console
- **Solution**: Try clicking different areas of the logout button

### **Issue: User still appears logged in**
- **Solution**: Check if localStorage was cleared properly
- **Solution**: Try refreshing the page after logout

### **Issue: Console shows errors**
- **Solution**: Check the error messages in console
- **Solution**: Make sure all files are saved and compiled

## 📝 **Debug Information:**

The logout process should show these console messages:
```
🔄 Logout button clicked
🔄 Signing out user...
✅ User signed out successfully
```

If you see different messages or errors, please share them so I can help debug further.

## 🎯 **Logout Button Location:**

The logout button should be located in the header/navigation area of the app, typically:
- In the top-right corner
- Near the user profile/avatar
- With a logout icon (LogOut from Lucide React)

The logout functionality is now properly connected and should work correctly! 🎉
