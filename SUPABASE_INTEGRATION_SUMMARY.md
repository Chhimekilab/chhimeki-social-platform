- **File**: `src/lib/supabase.js`
- Configured Supabase client with environment variable validation
- Added database helper functions for common operations
- Implemented proper error handling and connection management

### 2. Database Schema Design
- **File**: `database/schema.sql`
- Comprehensive social platform database with 11 main tables:
  - `users` - User profiles extending Supabase Auth
  - `posts` - User posts with media and engagement metrics
  - `comments` - Threaded comments system
  - `likes` - Like interactions for posts and comments
  - `follows` - User follow relationships
  - `communities` - Social communities and groups
  - `community_memberships` - Community membership tracking
  - `events` - Social events and meetups
  - `event_attendees` - Event RSVP tracking
  - `notifications` - User notification system
  - `messages` - Direct messaging
  - `saved_posts` - User bookmarks

### 3. Advanced Database Features
- **Automatic Counters**: Triggers for likes, followers, posts counts

- **Performance Optimization**: Strategic indexes for fast queries
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and check constraints
- **Enum Types**: Custom types for subscription tiers, post types, etc.

### 4. Authentication System
- **File**: `src/contexts/SupabaseAuthContext.js`
- Real Supabase authentication replacing mock system
- Automatic user profile creation on signup
- Session persistence and state management
- Password reset functionality
- Email confirmation support
- Maintains same API interface for seamless migration

### 5. Database Service Layer
- **File**: `src/services/database.js`
- Comprehensive service functions for all data operations:
  - **Users**: Profile management, search, followers/following
  - **Posts**: CRUD operations, feed generation, like functionality
  - **Comments**: Create, read, delete operations
  - **Communities**: Community management and membership
  - **Events**: Event creation and RSVP functionality
  - **Notifications**: Notification management and read status
  - **Follows**: Follow/unfollow operations
- Proper error handling and data validation
- Optimized queries with join operations

### 6. Environment Configuration
- **Files**: `.env.local`, `.env.example`
- Secure environment variable setup
- Development/production configurations
- Proper credential management

### 7. Sample Data
- **File**: `database/sample-data.sql`
- Pre-built sample data for testing
- Communities, events, posts, and user interactions
- Easy customization for different use cases

### 8. Documentation
- **File**: `SUPABASE_SETUP.md`
- Complete step-by-step setup guide
- Troubleshooting section
- Production deployment instructions
- Security best practices

## Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User signs up/logs in through Supabase Auth
2. Authentication context manages session state
3. User profile automatically created in `users` table
4. RLS policies ensure data security
5. Real-time session updates across components

### Data Access Pattern
```
Component → Service Function → Supabase Client → Database
```

### Security Implementation
- **Row Level Security** on all tables
- **User-based data isolation** (users can only access their own data)
- **Community privacy controls** (private communities)
- **Message encryption** (private between sender/recipient)
- **API key security** (environment variables, no hardcoding)

## Key Features Enabled

### Social Platform Core
- ✅ User registration and authentication
- ✅ User profiles with bio, avatar, verification status
- ✅ Post creation with text, images, and media
- ✅ Like and comment functionality
- ✅ User following/follower system
- ✅ Real-time updates and notifications

### Communities
- ✅ Community creation and management
- ✅ Public and private communities
- ✅ Role-based permissions (member, moderator, admin)
- ✅ Community-specific posts and discussions
- ✅ Member management and rules

### Events

- ✅ Real-time activity tracking
- ✅ Read/unread status management

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- **Posts**: Optimized for timeline queries (`created_at DESC`)
- **Users**: Fast username and profile lookups
- **Follows**: Efficient follower/following queries
- **Notifications**: Quick user notification retrieval
- **Messages**: Fast sender/recipient queries

### Query Optimization
- **Join operations** for related data fetching
- **Pagination support** for large datasets
- **Selective field queries** to reduce bandwidth
- **Batch operations** for bulk updates

## Security Features

### Row Level Security Policies
- Users can only edit their own profiles and content
- Private accounts are protected from unauthorized access
- Community privacy is enforced at the database level
- Messages are private between participants only

### Authentication Security
- Email verification for new accounts
- Secure password handling through Supabase Auth
- Session management with automatic refresh
- CSRF protection built-in

## Migration Path

### From Mock to Supabase
To switch from mock authentication to Supabase:

1. Update environment variables in `.env.local`
2. Run database schema in Supabase SQL Editor
3. Change import in `src/index.js`:
   ```javascript
   // From mock system
   import { AuthProvider } from './contexts/AuthContext';
   
   // To Supabase system
   import { AuthProvider } from './contexts/SupabaseAuthContext';
   ```

### Data Migration
- Existing mock data can be migrated using the sample data template
- User accounts need to be recreated through Supabase Auth
- Profile data can be imported via SQL or app interface
